"""
This module dedicated to Doubly-Connected Edge List data structure.
http://www.holmes3d.net/graphics/dcel/
At this stage the data structure works with faces only and does not support edges.

Advantages:
Have constant time access to the neighborhood of an arbitrary point can be very useful.
We can compute a normal for any given face easily, on demand, even if the vertex locations are changing.
We can also traverse every face touching a vertex (the "star" of the vertex) to easily estimate a normal for that vertex
If we are locally changing small portions of a mesh,
this is much easier than recomputing the normals for every vertex in the mesh.
Similarly, mesh simplification for Level of Detail or compressed storage becomes easier when neighbors are easily found.
Subdivision algorithms such as Loop and Catmull-Clark are relatively easy on a DCEL, especially adaptive subdivision.
