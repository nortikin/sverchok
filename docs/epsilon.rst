An explanation of Epsilon (and the computational limits imposed by 32bit floating point arithmetic)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This explanation is directed at the newcomer, for more elaborate

Blender’s ``Vector``
--------------------

Blender’s ``Vector`` datatypes are currently composed of 2 or more numbers, named "floats". *32bit floats* to be specific. A ``float`` is number with a decimal point and one or more digits behind the decimal point, for precision. The limit of the 32bit float precision is approximately 5 to 6 digits of significance. The reason for this limited precision is purely down to the amount of memory that 32bit floats are stored in. The choice to use 32bit floats in Blender is about lower memory usage and the non-critical / non-engineering “Artistic” nature of Blender’s origins.

Numpy ``datatypes``
-------------------

``Numpy`` offers 32bit and 64bit floats. 64bit floats store more information (more significant digits) and therefore take up more memory to store the value. They are a lot more precise.

What does this mean for Sverchok?
---------------------------------

Sverchok uses ``numpy`` extensively, but for some functionality we import Blender functions and they use ``Vector`` datatypes internally based around 32bit floats, those functions will have limited internal precision. To get the most accuracy out of these kinds of calculations the numbers need to be in the same order of magnitude throughout the whole calculation. Most users will rarely run into issues, but you might have if you are reading this.

How does this effect Sverchok? To begin to answer that, some context is needed.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For example if you have vectors with an ``x`` component of ``4000m``, then that number is ultimately accurate only to about a centimeter.

.. code:: python

   4000.01

You might see more numbers behind the decimal point, but consider those an illusion (an artifact) - only the first 5 or 6 numbers in the 32bit float will be considered significant.

In non-engineering tolerances in the real world what sense does it make to have a tolerance of centimeters on something that is 4 kilometer long. Especially if the end product is going to be a render. If you are rendering something that is 4km long, like a bridge, how many pixels would the render need to be wide to make a detail (like a weld-seam) of 1 centimeter thick appear in the render? That’s a big render.

If we think more about architectural structures, something like 40 meters (2 digits), well then the precision behind the decimal is

.. code:: python

    # 6 digits of total precision
    # 40m is 2 digits
    # remaining precision digits are:
    6-2 = 4.

    # a tenth of a millimeter. 
    40.0001


If you are rendering a 40m tall building, how many pixels would the render need to be high to see a details of a tenth of a millimeter? That’s a big render, it’s the same as the previous example.


Calculations and Epsilon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The core concept is: if your geometry uses big numbers, you can increase ``Epsilon`` to allow the tolerance in the calculations to be more in line with the magnitude of the numbers. If you have really small numbers (like millimeters) in your vectors, you want ``epsilon`` to be as small as possible.
