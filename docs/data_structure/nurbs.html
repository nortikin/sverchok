<h1>NURBS: Curves and Surfaces<a class="headerlink" href="#nurbs-curves-and-surfaces" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Among others, Sverchok supports a special kind of curves and surfaces, called
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline">NURBS</a> (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines). NURBS objects are widely used in 3D
graphics, and, especially, in CAD software.</p>
<p>Blender itself has support of NURBS objects, but it is limited at the moment;
NURBS support in Sverchok is wider.</p>
<p>At the moment, Sverchok supports two implementations of NURBS mathematics:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://onurraufbingol.com/NURBS-Python/">Geomdl</a>, a.k.a. NURBS-Python, library. It is relatively widely known and
used, so we consider it as better tested. However, to use this
implementation, you have to install Geomdl library into your Blender
installation. Please refer to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok/wiki/Dependencies">Dependencies</a> wiki page for installation
instructions.</p></li>
<li><p>Built-in (native) implementation in Sverchok itself. In many cases, it is
faster than Geomdl implementation, and it does not require any additional
dependencies.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.freecadweb.org/">FreeCAD</a> libraries. FreeCAD uses OpenCASCADE kernel, which is implemented in
C++, so it is faster than Geomdl implementation; it is also considered to be
more widely tested compared to Sverchok built-in implementation. However, it
is in general slower comparing to built-in implementation, when you want to
evaluate a lot of points on one curve or surface. Please refer to
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok/wiki/Dependencies">Dependencies</a> wiki page for installation instructions.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="terminology">
<h2>Terminology<a class="headerlink" href="#terminology" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>While widely used, for some reason, NURBS do not seem to have a “standard”
terminology: different software and different books use different terms for the
same things. Sverchok tries to not invent a 15th standard, and to follow the
terminology used in “The NURBS <a class="reference external" href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642973857">Book</a>”. Here we are listing some common terms
for reference.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Control Point</strong>: a point in 3D space, one of several points that define
common shape of the curve or surface. In general, NURBS curve / surface does
not go through it’s control points, apart of some special cases. NURBS
surfaces always have a rectangular grid of control points (m x n).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Control Polygon</strong> (for a curve): a polygon composed from control points of
a curve, connected with edges.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Control Net</strong> (for a surface): a grid-like mesh, composed from control
points of a surface, connected with edges.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Weight</strong>: a number, usually positive, which defines how strong a given
control point “attracts” the curve or surface. Sverchok can work with
negative weights usually, but there is a lot of software that can’t, so
usually you want to avoid use of negative weights.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Degree</strong>: an integer number, from 1 to however you want, which is the
degree of polynomials used in mathematical definition of NURBS curves. NURBS
surfaces have two degrees: one along U direction, and another along V
direction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-rational B-Spline</strong>, or simply <strong>B-Spline</strong>: a special kind of NURBS
objects, that does not allow to specify weights; it is the same as a NURBS
object with all weights set to 1.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rational B-Spline</strong>, or <strong>NURBS</strong>: a general kind of objects, that allows
to specify different weights for different control points. Mathematically,
such objects are defined as a relation of two polynomial expressions, hence
the name “rational”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Knot vector</strong>: a non-descending sequence of numbers, which define ranges of
curve/surface parameters, to which different control points have some
relation. It is hard to explain in a few words how exactly the knot vector
affects the shape of curve of surface, so for details please refer to the
literature. Each number in the knot vector is called <strong>knot</strong>. Knot vector of
a NURBS curve with degree <strong>p</strong> and <strong>n</strong> control points always must contain
exactly <strong>p + n + 1</strong> knots. NURBS surfaces have two knot vectors: one for U
parameter and one for V.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Knot multiplicity</strong>. A number of times one knot is repeated in the knot
vector. For example, if we have a knot vector <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0</span> <span class="pre">1</span> <span class="pre">2</span> <span class="pre">2</span> <span class="pre">2</span> <span class="pre">3</span> <span class="pre">4</span> <span class="pre">5</span></code>, then we
say that knot 2 has multiplicity of 3.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Uniform knot vector</strong>: a knot vectors, values in which increase always by
the same amount (uniformly). For example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0</span> <span class="pre">1</span> <span class="pre">2</span> <span class="pre">3</span> <span class="pre">4</span> <span class="pre">5</span></code>. Sometimes this
kind of knot vectors is called “periodic” (for reasons that we have no place
to explain here). Uniform knot vectors are not very often used, because
curves with such knot vectors do not pass through their first and last
control points (in general).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clamped knot vector</strong>. A special kind of knot vector, which has
multiplicity of it’s first and last knots equal to <strong>p +1</strong>, where <strong>p</strong> is
the degree of the curve (or surface, along one of directions). For example,
if we are talking about a curve with degree equal to 2, then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0</span> <span class="pre">0</span> <span class="pre">0</span> <span class="pre">1</span> <span class="pre">2</span> <span class="pre">3</span> <span class="pre">4</span>
<span class="pre">5</span> <span class="pre">5</span> <span class="pre">5</span></code> is a clamped knot vector. Curves with such knot vectors have a good
property: they always pass through their first and last control points. This
is a reason why clamped knot vectors are widely used.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clamped Uniform knot vector</strong>. Knot vector which is “almost uniform”, but
clamped; i.e. it has multiplicity of first and last knots equal to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">p+1</span></code>,
but all other knots are ascending evenly. For example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0</span> <span class="pre">0</span> <span class="pre">1</span> <span class="pre">2</span> <span class="pre">3</span> <span class="pre">4</span> <span class="pre">4</span></code> is a
clamped uniform knot vector.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-Uniform knot vector</strong>. Most general form of knot vectors. Knot vector,
in which distance between neighbour knots is different in different places.
For example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0</span> <span class="pre">0</span> <span class="pre">0.5</span> <span class="pre">0.6</span> <span class="pre">1.5</span> <span class="pre">1.7</span> <span class="pre">1.9</span> <span class="pre">2</span> <span class="pre">2</span> <span class="pre">2</span></code> is a non-uniform (and clamped)
knot vector.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Node values</strong>, <strong>Node points</strong>. Also known as Greville abscissaes and
Greville points, average knot values, or simply edit points. The values of
NURBS curve’s T parameter, defined as: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">t[i]</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">sum(u[i+j]</span> <span class="pre">for</span> <span class="pre">j</span> <span class="pre">from</span> <span class="pre">1</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">p)</span>
<span class="pre">/</span> <span class="pre">p</span></code>, where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">u</span></code> is curve’s knotvector, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">p</span></code> is curve’s degree.  NURBS
curve <em>node points</em> (or Greville points) are points at the curve at parameter
values equal to node values.  The number of curve’s nodes is equal to the
number of curve’s control points.  Node points of the curve are positioned on
the curve near corresponding control points. So in many NURBS algorithms,
node points are used to define the shape of NURBS curve, instead of control
points.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="workflow">
<h2>Workflow<a class="headerlink" href="#workflow" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Some software products have a “full NURBS workflow”, which means that all curves /
surfaces it is operating with is always NURBS, and whatever complex things you
do with those objects you will always have NURBS again.
Sverchok does not have a goal to have “full NURBS workflow”, at least at the
moment. Blender is, first of all, a mesh editing software, so, it is very
probable, that the most widely used workflow always will be to manipulate with
NURBS curves / objects for some time, together with other types of curves /
objects, but then convert them to mesh and apply some nodes that manipulate
with mesh, to receive a mesh in the end.</p>
<p>Some nodes have “NURBS output” parameter in their settings; when this parameter
is enabled, they output NURBS objects, otherwise a generic curve or surface is
generated.</p>
<p>There are some number of nodes, that can be called <strong>NURBS-transparent</strong>;
such nodes have a property: when they receive NURBS on the input, they will
always output NURBS. Examples of NURBS-transparent nodes are “Ruled Surface”
and “Surface of Revolution”. Some nodes are NURBS-transparent only when you
enable some setting in them (see documentation of specific nodes). Number of
NURBS-transparent nodes will probably grow, but there is no guarantee that some
time all curve / surface processing nodes will become NURBS-transparent (and
there is no such goal at the moment).</p>
<p>“NURBS-transparent” nodes also automatically convert several special kinds of
curves into NURBS, when such curves are passed to inputs of such nodes. We call
types of curves, that can be automatically (and exactly, not approximately)
converted to NURBS, “NURBS-like”. Examples of NURBS-like curves are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Bezier curves</p></li>
<li><p>Cubic splines</p></li>
<li><p>Polylines</p></li>
<li><p>Circular arcs</p></li>
<li><p>Line segments</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Sverchok has “NURBS to JSON” and “JSON to NURBS” nodes, which allow to save
NURBS objects in JSON format and read NURBS from it; such JSON format can be
used with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/orbingol/rw3dm">rw3dm</a> utility to convert it from / to <cite>3dm</cite> files. Later there can
appear nodes that will export NURBS objects to other widely-used formats.</p>
<p>So, with some restrictions, it is possible to prepare complex scenes built from
NURBS objects only, to export them to other CAD software for further processing
or manufacturing. This is, however, not a primary workflow at the moment.</p>
</section>
<section id="blender-nurbs-compatibility">
<h2>Blender NURBS compatibility<a class="headerlink" href="#blender-nurbs-compatibility" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Blender’s internal NURBS support is currently limited in two aspects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It’s Python API for manipulating NURBS objects is very poor;</p></li>
<li><p>It does not allow to specify an arbitrary knot vector for curve or surface;
only two special kinds of knot vectors are supported: “clamped uniform knot
vectors” and “uniform knot vectors”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, Sverchok has limited features in interacting with Blender’s native NURBS objects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>NURBS Input</strong> node can bring arbitrary Blender’s NURBS curves or surfaces
from scene to Sverchok space;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>NURBS Curve Out</strong> and <strong>NURBS Surface Out</strong> nodes allow to generate
Blender’s NURBS objects in scene, but without possibility to specify
arbitrary knot vectors.</p></li>
</ul>
