Introduction
------------

When you want to express an idea in written form and the concept is suitable
for a one line Python expression then often you can use a Formula node. If you
need access to imports, classes, temporary variables, and functions then you can 
write a script to load into ScriptNode. 

ScriptNode (SN) allows you to write multi-line python programs that define 
the functionality of a Node, while avoiding some of the boilerplate associated 
with a regular Node. SN can be used as an environment for experimenting 
with algorithms. Scripts written for SN are easily converted to full PyNodes.

It's a prototype so bug reports are welcome.

Features
--------

allows:

- Loading/Reloading scripts currently in TextEditor
- imports and aliasing, ie anything you can import from console works in SN
- nested functions and lambdas
- named inputs and outputs
- named operators (buttons to action something upon button press)

Structure
---------

At present all scripts for SN must (strict list - general):

- have 1 `sv_main` function as the main workhorse
- `sv_main` must take 1 or more arguments (even if you don't use it)
- all function arguments for ``sv_main`` must have defaults.
- each script shall define ``in_sockets`` and ``out_sockets``
- `ui_operators` is an optional third output parameter

**sv_main()**


``sv_main()`` can take int, float and list or nested list.
Here are some legal examples::

    def sv_main(vecs_in_multi=[[]], vecs_in_flat=[], some_var=1, some_ratio=1.2):
        pass

    [[]]        # for nested input (lists of lists of any data type currently supported)
    []          # for flat (one list)
    int, float  # for single value input

**in_sockets**

::

    in_sockets = [
        [type, 'socket name on ui', input_variable],
        [type, 'socket name on ui 2', input_variable2],
        # ...
    ]

**out_sockets**

::

    out_sockets = [
        [type, 'socket name on ui', output_variable],
        [type, 'socket name on ui 2', output_variable2],
        # ...
    ]

**in_sockets and out_sockets**

- Each *socket name on ui* string shall be unique.

- **type** are currently limited to
   
   +---------+-------------------------------------+
   | type id | type data                           | 
   +=========+=====================================+
   | 's'     | floats, ints, edges, faces, strings |
   +---------+-------------------------------------+
   | 'v'     | vertices, vectors, 3-tuples         | 
   +---------+-------------------------------------+
   | 'm'     | matrices, 4 x 4 nested lists        |
   +---------+-------------------------------------+



**ui_operators**

::

    ui_operators = [
        ['button_name', func1]
    ]

- Here `func1` is the function you want to call when pressing the button.
- Each `"button_name"` is the text you want to appear on the button.
  For simplicity it must be a unique and valid python variable name 

     - with no special characters (``|().\/...etc``)
     - doesn't start with a number
     - contains no spaces, use single underscores if you need word separation. The UI code replaces underscores with spaces.
 

**return**


Simple, only two flavours are allowed at the moment. ::

    return in_sockets, out_sockets
    return in_sockets, out_sockets, ui_operators

Templates
---------

Sverchok includes a list of easily accessible examples and templates. They can be accessed 
from the SN node if nothing is loaded, or from the `Template Menu` in `TextEditor` as ``sv NodeScripts``.


Conveniences
------------

We vale our time, i'm sure you do too, so features have been added to help speed up the 
script creation process.

**Text Editor**

- has automatic ``in_sockets`` list creation when the key cursor is over ``sv_main``. 
  (please note: it doesn't attempt to detect if you want nested verts or edge/polygon so it assumes you want 'v')

  - kb shortcut: ``Ctrl+I -> Generate in_sockets``

- can also convert a template description (like `kv lang` if you know Kivy) into 
  valid ScriptNode ready python. Example `available here <https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok/issues/376#issuecomment-54062710>`_

  - kb shortcut: ``Ctrl+I -> Convert svlang``

- can refresh the Script Node which currently loads that script by hitting ``Ctrl+Enter``


Examples
--------

The best way to get familiarity with SN is to go through the templates folder.
They are intended to be lightweight and educational, but some of them will show
advanced use cases. The images and animations on this `thread on github 
<https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok/issues/85>`_. 
may also provide some insight into what's possible.

A typical nodescript may look like this::


    from math import sin, cos, radians, pi
    from mathutils import Vector, Euler


    def sv_main(n_petals=8, vp_petal=20, profile_radius=1.3, amp=1.0):

        in_sockets = [
            ['s', 'Num Petals',  n_petals],
            ['s', 'Verts per Petal',  vp_petal],
            ['s', 'Profile Radius', profile_radius],
            ['s', 'Amp',  amp],
        ]

        # variables
        z_float = 0.0
        n_verts = n_petals * vp_petal
        section_angle = 360.0 / n_verts
        position = (2 * (pi / (n_verts / n_petals)))

        # consumables
        Verts = []

        # makes vertex coordinates
        for i in range(n_verts):
            # difference is a function of the position on the circumference
            difference = amp * cos(i * position)
            arm = profile_radius + difference
            ampline = Vector((arm, 0.0, 0.0))

            rad_angle = radians(section_angle * i)
            myEuler = Euler((0.0, 0.0, rad_angle), 'XYZ')

            # changes the vector in place, successive calls are accumulative
            # we reset at the start of the loop.
            ampline.rotate(myEuler)
            x_float = ampline.x
            y_float = ampline.y
            Verts.append((x_float, y_float, z_float))

        # makes edge keys, ensure cyclic
        Edges = [[i, i + 1] for i in range(n_verts - 1)]
        Edges.append([i, 0])

        out_sockets = [
            ['v', 'Verts', [Verts]],
            ['s', 'Edges', [Edges]],
        ]

        return in_sockets, out_sockets

but we are not forced to have all code inside sv_main, we can also do::


    def lorenz(N, verts):
        add_vert = verts.append
        h = 0.01
        a = 10.0
        b = 28.0
        c = 8.0 / 3.0
    
        x0 = 0.1
        y0 = 0
        z0 = 0
        for i in range(N):
            x1 = x0 + h * a * (y0 - x0)
            y1 = y0 + h * (x0 * (b - z0) - y0)
            z1 = z0 + h * (x0 * y0 - c * z0)
            x0, y0, z0 = x1, y1, z1
    
            add_vert((x1,y1,z1))
    
    def sv_main(N=1000):
    
        verts = []
        in_sockets = [['s', 'N', N]]
        out_sockets = [['v','verts', [verts]]]
        
        lorenz(N, verts)
        return in_sockets, out_sockets


We can even define classes inside the .py file, or import from elsewhere.

Here's a `ui_operator` example, it acts like a throughput (because in and out
are still needed by design). You'll notice that inside `func1` the node's input
socket is accessed using `SvGetSockeyAnyType(...)`. It is probably more logical
if we could access the input data directly from the variable `items_in`,
currently this is not possible -- therefor the solution is to use what
sverchok nodes use in their internal code too. The upshot, is that this exposes
you to how you might access the socket content of other nodes. Experiment :)

::

    def sv_main(items_in=[[]]):

        in_sockets = [
            ['v', 'items_in', items_in]]

        def func1():
            # directly from incoming Object_in socket.
            sn = bpy.context.node

            # safe? or return early
            if not (sn.inputs and sn.inputs[0].links):
                return

            verts = SvGetSocketAnyType(sn, sn.inputs['items_in'])
            print(verts)

        out_sockets = [['v', 'Verts', items_in]]
        ui_operators = [['print_names', func1]]

        return in_sockets, out_sockets, ui_operators


Breakout Scripts
----------------

For lack of a better term, SN scripts written in this style let you pass
variables to a script located in ``/sverchok-master/..`` or
``/sverchok-master/your_module_name/some_library``. To keep your sverchok-master
folder organized I recommend using a module folder. In the example below,
I made a folder inside sverchok-master called ``sv_modules`` and inside that I
have a file called `sv_curve_utils`, which contains a function `loft`. This way
of coding requires a bit of setup work, but then you can focus purely on
the algorithm inside `loft`. ::


    from mathutils import Vector, Euler, Matrix
    import sv_modules
    from sv_modules.sv_curve_utils import loft

    def sv_main(verts_p=[], edges_p=[], verts_t=[], edges_t=[]):

        in_sockets = [
            ['v', 'verts_p', verts_p],
            ['s', 'edges_p', edges_p],
            ['v', 'verts_t', verts_t],
            ['s', 'edges_t', edges_t]]

        verts_out = []

        def out_sockets():
            return [['v', 'verts_out', verts_out]]

        if not all([verts_p, edges_p, verts_t, edges_t]):
            return in_sockets, out_sockets()

        # while developing, it can be useful to uncomment this
        if 'loft' in globals():
            import imp
            imp.reload(sv_modules.sv_curve_utils)
            from sv_modules.sv_curve_utils import loft

        verts_out = loft(verts_p[0], verts_t[0])  #  this is your break-out code

        # here the call to out_sockets() will pick up verts_out
        return in_sockets, out_sockets()


Techniques to improve Python performance
----------------------------------------

There are many ways to speed up python code. Some slowness will be down to
innefficient algorithm design, other slowness is caused purely by how much
processing is minimally required to solve a problem. A decent read regarding
general methods to improve python code performance can be found
on `python.org <https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips>`_.
If you don't know where the cycles are being consumed, then you don't know
if your efforts to optimize will have any significant impact.

Read these 5 rules by Rob Pike before any optimization.

Limitations
-----------

Most limitations are voided by increasing your Python and ``bpy`` skills.

Future
------

SN iteration 1 is itself a prototype and is a testing ground for iteration 2.
The intention was always to provide multiple programming language interfaces,
initially coffeescript because it's a lightweight language with crazy expressive
capacity. iteration 2 might work a little different, perhaps working from
within a class but trying to do extra introspection to reduce boilerplate.

The only reason in_sockets needs to be declared at the moment is if you want
to have socket names that are different than the function arguments. It
would be possible to allow `sv_main()` to take zero arguments too.
So possible configurations should be::

    sv_main()
    sv_main() + in_sockets
    sv_main() + out_sockets
    sv_main(a=[],..)
    sv_main(a=[],..) + in_sockets
    sv_main(a=[],..) + out_sockets
    sv_main(a=[],..) + in_socket + out_sockets

etc, with ui_operators optional to all combinations


That's it for now.
