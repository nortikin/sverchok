2 Point Spline
==============

Functionality
-------------

Single section Bezier Spline. Creates a *Spline Curve* from 2 sets of points. Analogue to the Blender native Curve object, but limited to 2 pairs of *knots* and *control points* per curve.

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                                 |
+===========+========+=============================================================+
| num verts | int    | per curve this sets how many verts define the curve         |
+-----------+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| knot 1    | Vector | These place and adjust the shape of the curve. The knots    |
+-----------+--------+ are vectors on the curve, the controls are vectors to which |
| control 1 | Vector | the curve is mathematically attracted                       | 
+-----------+--------+                                                             | 
| control 2 | Vector |                                                             |

| knot 2    | Vector |                                                             |

The node accepts these 
The node will adjust to make sure the length of 


Parameters
---------

The Node is vectorized in the following way. If any of the *knots* or *control points* are given in a list that doesn't match the length of the other lists, then the last value of that shorter list is repeated to match the length of the longest. 

This means; if *knot1, control1, knot2* are length 3, 4 and 8 and control2 is length 20 then 
*knot1, control1, knot2* will all get their last value repeated till the full list matches 20 values.

The same *filling* procedure is applied to the *Num Verts* parameter.

Outputs
-------

- (verts, edges) : A set of each of these that correspond with a packet of commands like 'knot1, ctrl1, ctrl2, knot2'
- verts needs to be connected to get output
- edges is optional

**optionals for visualizing the curve handles**

- hnd. Verts 
- hnd. Edges

Passing hnd.Verts and hnd.Edges to a ViewerDraw node helps visualize the Handles that operate on your Spline curve.
