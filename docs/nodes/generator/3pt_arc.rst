3 Point Arc
===========

Functionality
-------------

Given a *start coordinate*, a *through coordinate*, and an *end coordinate* this Node will find the Arc that passes through those points.

Inputs
------

- arc_pts input is `[begin, mid, end, begin, mid, end, begin, mid, end..... ]`

    - must be (len % 3 == 0 )

- num verts is either  

    - constant
    - unique
    - or repeats last value if the number of arcs exceeds the number of values in the `num_vert` list


Parameters
----------

The UI is quite minimal. 


- **num verts** can be changed via Slider input on the UI or as described above, it can be fed multiple values through the input sockets.


Output
------ 

- (verts, edges) : A set of each of these that correspond with a packet of commands like 'start, through, end, num_verts'
- verts needs to be connected to get output
- edges is optional
