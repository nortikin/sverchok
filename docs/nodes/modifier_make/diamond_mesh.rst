Diamond Mesh
============

Functionality
-------------

This node generates a new (rhomboidal / diamond-like) mesh, by replacing each
edge of original mesh by a rhombus (connecting centers of two incidential
faces). This can give interesting topology, especially in combination with
"dual mesh" and/or "triangulate" and/or "join triangles" and/or "limited
dissolve" nodes.

Inputs
------

This node has the following inputs:

- **Vertices**. Vertices of original mesh. This input is mandatory.
- **Edges**. Edges of original mesh.
- **Faces**. Faces of original mesh. This input is mandatory.

Outputs
-------

This node has the following outputs:

- **Vertices**. Vertices of the diamond mesh.
- **Edges**. Edges of the diamond mesh.
- **Faces**. Faces of the diamond mesh.

Examples of Usage
