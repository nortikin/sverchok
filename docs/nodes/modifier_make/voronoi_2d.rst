Voronoi 2D
==========

Functionality
-------------

This node creates 2D Voronoi partition based on input list of points.

Inputs
------

*Vertices* - list of vertices. But since partition is two dimensional, Z-coordinate of vertex is not considered.

Parameters
----------

*Clipping* -

Outputs
-------

*Vertices* - list of vertices of Voronoi partition.

*Edges* - list of edges of Voronoi partition.
