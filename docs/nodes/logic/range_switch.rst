Range Switch
============

Functionality
-------------

This node set a switch state to ON/OFF based on a driving value relative to a given value range.


Inputs
------

All inputs will accept single values.

- **Value**
- **Boundary1** [1]
- **Boundary2** [1]

Notes:
[1] : The boundary values do not have to be in increasing order or absolute.


Parameters
----------

The **Mode** parameter allows to select one of the three switch modes: **Inside ON**, **Inside OFF** and **Pass Through**.

- For **Inside ON** mode the switch is ON when the value is inside the boundary range and OFF otherwise.
- For **Inside OFF** mode the switch is OFF when the value is inside the boundary range and ON otherwise.
- For **Pass Through** mode the switch will toggle betwen OFF/ON (or ON/OFF) when the value crossess the range from one side to the other.

    (-) ----[0]---outside---[b1]---inside---[b2]---outside ---> (+)

    INSIDE ON mode:

    OFF      |b1|    ON     |b2|    OFF     # inside ON,  outside OFF

    INSIDE OFF mode:

    ON       |b1|    OFF    |b2|    ON      # inside OFF, outside ON

    PASS THROUGH mode:

    ON  ->   |b1|  - ON ->  |b2| -> OFF     # pass through switches state
    ON  <-   |b1| <- OFF -  |b2| <- OFF     #

| **Value**        | Float         | 1.0          | The driving value of the switch  |
+------------------+---------------+--------------+----------------------------------+
| **Boundary1**    | Float         | 2.0          | The first boundary of the range  |
+------------------+---------------+--------------+----------------------------------+
| **Boundary2**    | Float         | 3.0          | The second boundary of the range |

Notes:
[1] : When the mode is **Pass Through** a "Toggle State" button becomes available to allow you to set the initial state of the switch.


Outputs
-------
Outputs will be generated when connected.

**State**
This output is the current state of the switch. (ON = True, OFF = False)

**Zone**
This output is the number of the zone (1,2,3) the driving value is in relative to the boundary values.

Zone 1 = value < min(b1,b2)
Zone 2 = min(b1,b2) < value < max(b1, b2)
Zone 3 = max(b1,b2) < value
