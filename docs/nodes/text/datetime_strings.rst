Datetime Strings
================

This is a beta node. Please visit  https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok/pull/2137

This node processes dates formatted as text, and lets you convert them into an ordinal (a day indication, an integer). It also supports the subordinal (float, what percent into the day, *seconds / total_seconds_in_day* ).
