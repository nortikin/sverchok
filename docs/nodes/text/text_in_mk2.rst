Functionality
-------------

Import data from text editor in formats csv, json or plain sverchok text.

Properties
----------

**Select** - Select text from blender text editor (or import and select)

**Select input format** - Property to choose between csv, plain sverchok and json data format

  **csv**:
    **Header fields** - to use headers from file
    **Dialect** - to choose dialect of imported table
    **Skip N Lines** - to skip a number of introduction lines in a non standard CSV

  **Sverchok**:
    **Data type** - output data socket as selected type

  **JSON**:
    this is for loading a file generated by sverchok, it is not a generic json loader. It is not clear how
    we would implement such a thing anyway. our Sverchok JSON output formats the data in a specific way.

**Load** - Load data from text in blend file

the N-panel has a "force input" mode for CSV to automatically try to do the right thing when the CSV is
a mixed bad of strings with quotes and numbers. Try this is the file won't load correctly. (else let us know in the issue tracker)

Outputs
-------

**vertices**, **data**, **matrices** - if sverchok plain data selected

**Col** - if csv data selected

**Random** - if json data selected
