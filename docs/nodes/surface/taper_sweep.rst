Taper Sweep Surface
===================

Functionality
-------------

This node generates a surface by sweeping a curve (called "profile") along an
axis. While the curve is moved, it is scaled according to another curve (called
"taper curve").

This node is a generalization of "revolution surface" node: when the "profile"
curve is a circle, this node will generate a revolution surface from "taper"
curve.

Domain / parametrization specifics: Domain along U parameter is the same as
domain of the "profile" curve. Domain along V parameter is the same as the
domain of the "taper" curve.

Inputs
------

This node has the following inputs:

* **Profile**. The profile curve. This input is mandatory.
* **Taper**. The taper curve. This input is mandatory.
* **Point**. The point on the taper axis line. The default value is `(0, 0, 0)`.
* **Direction**. The directing vector of the taper axis line. The default value is `(0, 0, 1)` (Z axis).

Outputs
-------

This node has the following output:

* **Surface**. The generated surface.

Example of usage
----------------

The taper curve is generated by "filleting" some line; the profile curve is filleted square:
