Surface from Curves
===================

Functionality
-------------

This node generates a Surface object by interpolating several Curves. Two interpolation modes are supported: linear and cubic.

Surface domain: from 0 to 1 in both directions.

Inputs
------

This node has the following inputs:

* **Curves**. The list of curves to interpolate between. For Linear
  interpolation, at least two curves are required; for Cubic interpolation, at
  least three curves are required.

Parameters
----------

This node has the following parameters:

* **Interpolation mode**. The available values are **Linear** and **Cubic**.
  The default mode is **Linear**.
* **Cyclic**. This defines whether the surface should be cyclic (closed) in the
  U direction - i.e., should the node create an interpolation between the last
  curve and the first one. Unchecked by default.

Outputs
-------

This node has the following output:

* **Surface**. The generated surface.

Examples of usage

The same but with Cubic interpolation:
