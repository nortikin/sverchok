===============================

Functionality
-------------

Takes vector in local object space and returns color of corresponding pixel on UV map.
Works most accurately on triangulated meshes. Quads are ok if not distorted much. Object must have UV layer unwrapped.
Vertical and horizontal resolution of the image must be exactly the same for this node to work properly.

Inputs
------

- **Point on mesh** points placed near to, or on surface of object.

Outputs
-------
