Pulga Drag Force
=================

Functionality
-------------

This node creates a force to be applied with the Pulga Physics Solver node.

The generated effect is similar to the friction generated by the environment slowing the particle.

The force direction will be opposite to the particle velocity.

The force magnitude will be:  Strength*(Velocity to the power of Exponent) * Square of the Radius

Input
-----

**Strength**: Multiplier of the force, if multiple values are given the will be use as strength per particle.

**Exponent**: Defines the type of environment friction. (2 = Liquid)
