Curve Viewer
============

Functionality
-------------

This node takes ``verts`` and ``edges`` and makes straight sections of Curve to represent them. Like a pipe, but without smooth transitions between pipes. Each edge is truely disjoint and the renderable geometry can overlap.

This is useful for quickly generating renderable lightweight geometry for scaffolding, beams, pillars, plynths, tubes, fences, neon signage.
