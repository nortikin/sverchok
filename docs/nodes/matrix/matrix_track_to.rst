Matrix Track To
===============

Functionality
-------------

Generates the transformation **matrix** given a location, a scale and a rotation defined by the given set of Track & Up vectors.

The "Track/Up Axes" and the "Track/Up Mapping" settings allow to set any two of the X, Y, Z axes to be the **Track** axis and the **Up** axis and to map them to any of the two input vectors A and B (or to their negatives). The first axis listed in these dropdown lists is the Track axis/vector and the second is the Up axis/vector.

The axis selected to be the Track axis (the first letter in "Track/Up Axes" selection) will be precisely oriented along the Track vector (whichever the Track vector is mapped to, based on the "Track/Up mapping"), while the axis selected to be the Up axis (the second letter the "Track/Up Axes" selection) will be approximately oriented along the Up vector (whichever the Up vector is mapped to, based on the "Track/Up mapping" selection). If the A and B inputs happen to be orthogonal to eachother then the Track and Up axes will be precisely oriented along the selected Track/Up vectors, otherwise the Up axis will only approximately be oriented towards the Up vector, perpendicular to the Track axis, and reside within the AB plane. The third axis (X, Y or Z) is determined via cross product from the other two as to provide an ortho-normal, right handed, XYZ coordinate sytem.

Outputs
-------

**Matrix**, **X**, **Y**, **Z**.
All outputs will be generated when connected.

The **Matrix** is the homogeneous 4x4 matrix composed by the given location, rotation and scale : m = T * R * S. [1]

The **X**, **Y**, **Z** are the orthonormal vectors, oriented along the Track and Up axes. [2]

Notes:
[1] : The rotation component is ortho-normal only if the "Normalize Vectors" option is ON (in the Propety Panel).
[2] : The axes are ortho-normal only if the "Normalize Vectors" option is ON (in the Propety Panel), otherwise the vectors are only orthogonal.
