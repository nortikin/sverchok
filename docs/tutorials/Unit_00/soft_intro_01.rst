Unit 00. Introduction to Blender 2.8+, the NodeView and 3DView
**************************************************************

Sverchok Installed, what now?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have a tickbox beside the Sverchok add-on in the Add-ons list in User Preferences, then it’s safe to assume the add-on is enabled. To
show the basics you need to have a NodeView open, and it’s useful to have a 3DView open at the same time.

NodeView and 3DView
-------------------

|image1|

1. **Split a View**:

   To do this we can split the existing 3DView into two views, by
   leftclicking into the little triangle/diagonal lines in the bottom
   left of the 3dview, and dragging to the right.

2. **Switch a View**:

   Now you have two windows, switch one of them in the Editor Type dropdown. If Sverchok is installed correctly it will be listed here as Sverchok Nodes

3. **Make a new Tree**:

   When you start out you will have to press the New button to make a new node tree called (by default) NodeTree

4. **Adding Nodes to the View**:

   From the NodeView, you can use the following ways to add nodes to tree:

   * Use the **Add** menu from menu bar (Sverchok has little control over how this menu is laid out, protip: use the next method instead)

     |image6|

   * Hit *Shift-A* (standard Blender's shortcut for adding things, we inject our own menu into it, with icons!):

     - don't be alarmed if what you see in your menu is not 100% identical to this image, new features are continuously added/changed.

   * Hit *Alt-Space*. This shortcut calls for a special search menu, which allows you to search for nodes and macros:

     - once you get to know Sverchok you can type in "trigger" words associated with a node, to quickly narrow down the search list.
     - trigger macros using ``> some word``. More about macros later. If you stick with Sverchok they will be your secret weapon.

   * Use Blender's standard search box, which appears when you hit *F3* in node view:

     - this search box contains Operators for adding any sverchok node to the view, but you'll also find that it contains all other relevant Operators for that view. Sverchok also registers a few general Application Operators, and this is one way to execute them if you know what you're looking for.
