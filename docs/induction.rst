You have installed the addon, if not then read the installation notes. If you've ever used Nodes for anything in Blender, Cycles / Compositor Nodes feel free to continue straight to Unit 01 if you see the RNA icon in the list of NodeView types.

This section will introduce you to a selection of nodes that can be combined
to create renderable geometry. Starting with the simple Plane generator

Unit 00 - Introduction to NodeView and 3DView
---------------------------------------------

The following Unit(s) will introduce you to the essential parts of the Blender interface that Sverchok uses: The 3DView and the Node Editor (NodeView)

   Lesson 01 - Orientation for Blender Newcomers <Unit_00/soft_intro_01>



Unit 01 - Introduction to modular components
--------------------------------------------

The following Units will introduce no more than 10 node types per lesson. Take your time to get through the parts that are text heavy, some concepts take longer to explain not because they are difficult to understand, but because there is simply more to cover.
