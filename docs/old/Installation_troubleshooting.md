### Troubleshooting Installation Errors

#### NumPy

We now include NumPy code in Sverchok nodes, this means that you should have an up-to-date version of NumPy on your machine. Normally if you get your Blender precompiled NumPy will be included with Python, however this isn't always the case. The windows builds on blender buildbot may contain a cut down version of NumPy due to the licenses under which it can be spread in compiled form.

If you get an error when enabling Sverchok the last lines of the error are important, if it mentions:   

-  ImportError: No module named 'numpy'
-  multiarray
-  DLL failure
-  Module use of python33.dll conflicts with this version of Python

then here are steps to fix that*.  

- download and install Python 3.4.(1) for your os
- download and install NumPy 1.8 (for python 3.4) for your os.
- in the Blender directory rename the `python` folder to `_python` so Blender uses your local Python 3.4 install.  
    
binaries  
python: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-341/  
numpy: http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/  

To confirm that NumPy is installed properly on your system, for py3.4, launch your python34 interpretter/console and the following NumPy import should produce no error.


```
Python 3.4.1 (v3.4.1:c0e311e010fc, May 18 2014, 10:38:22) <edited>
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import numpy
>>> 
```

*If you get an error, this means NumPy failed to install. We can't really troubleshoot that
