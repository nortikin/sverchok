Questions
=========

If there are any question then fastest way to get an answer is to ask in Discord chat.
Another place for questions is issue tracker on the Github page.
Also good place for questions is Blender stack exchange site.
Before asking questions have a look at the Sverchok documentation
and use search because it's possible that the question was already answered.

Proposals

Best place for proposals is GitHub issue tracker. It's simpler to get more opinions
