Functionality
-------------

This node attempts to allow procedural access to the GreasePencil system. It accepts geometry and colours. The node is not extensively tested against the most recent API changes, the GreasePencil subsystem has many more features than could possible be sanely exposed inside one Node. Here again is a node that offers convenience at the cost of customizablity.

**Current state of node**:  seems slightly broken due to Blender API updates.
