NURBS Input
===========

Dependencies
------------

This node can optionally use Geomdl_ library.

.. _Geomdl: https://onurraufbingol.com/NURBS-Python/

Functionality
-------------

This node allows to bring NURBS_ Curve and / or Surface objects from Blender's scene into Sverchok.

.. _NURBS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline

Inputs
------

This node does not have any inputs.

Operators
---------

This node has the following operator button:

* **GET**. When pressed, the node will update the list of objects bringed into
  Sverchok with a list of currently selected objects. If there are objects
  along selected ones, which are not NURBS curves or surfaces, the node will
  skip them.

Parameters
----------

This node has the following parameters:

* **Implementation**. This defines the implementation of NURBS mathematics to be used. The available options are:

  * **Geomdl**. Use Geomdl_ library. This option is available only when Geomdl package is installed.
  * **Sverchok**. Use built-in Sverchok implementation.
  
  In general, built-in implementation should be faster; but Geomdl implementation is better tested.
  The default option is **Geomdl**, when it is available; otherwise, built-in implementation is used.

* **Sort**. If checked, the node will sort selected objects by name. Checked by default.
* **Apply matrices**. If checked, the node will apply all transforms to
  Blender's objects before bringing the coordinates into Sverchok. Checked by
  default.

In the lower part of the node, the list of currently imported objects is shown.
