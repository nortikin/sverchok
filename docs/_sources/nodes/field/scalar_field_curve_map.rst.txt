Functionality
-------------

This node generates a Vector Field object by applying a Curve object to Scalar Field object.

A Scalar Field is a function, which returns a number for each point in 3D
space, i.e. ``S(v) : R^3 -> R``. A Curve is a function, which returns a point
in 3D space for each number in some domain, i.e. ``C(t) : R -> R^3``. So, given
a Scalar Field S and a Curve C, we can compose these two functions, to obtain a
new function: ``V(v) = C(S(v))``. This way we will have a function, which
returns a 3D vector for each point in 3D space. Such function is called Vector
Field.

If we have a Curve C, then we also have it's tangent vector function ``T(t) : R
-> R^3`` and it's normal vector function ``N(t) : R -> R^3``. We can use these
functions to compose them with a Scalar Field as well.

This node can be useful to construct vector (or scalar) fields of complex shape
from a simple scalar field and some curve.

Inputs
------

This node has the following inputs:

* **Field**. A Scalar Field to be used. This input is mandatory.
* **Curve**. A Curve to be used. This input is mandatory.

Parameters
----------

This node has the following parameter:

* **Curve usage**. This defines what function of a curve will be used. The available options are:

  * **Curve points**. Radius-vectors of curve points will be used.
  * **Curve tangents**. Curve tangent vectors will be used.
  * **Curve normals**. Curve normal vectors will be used.

  The default value is **Curve points**.

Outputs
-------

This node has the following output:

* **Field**. The generated Vector Field object. You can use **Decompose Vector
  Field** node to deconstruct it into three scalar fields.
