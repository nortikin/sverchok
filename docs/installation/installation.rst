There are two options from where to install Sverchok. If you want to get most stable version than it's recommended
to download zip archive from the `last stable release page <https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok/releases/latest>`_.
Also you can download zip archive with latest changes from `main GitHub page <https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok>`_.

After the Sverchok archive is downloaded open property window in Blender (:kbd:`Ctrl+Alt+U`):

Choose add-on tab, push *install from file* button and choose downloaded ZIP archive file:

And activate Sverchok with flag:

If the add-on was enabled successfully open Sverchok editor and create new node tree. Now you can add new nodes.
If the add-on was not enabled open system console ``Window -> Toggle system console`` and create 
`new issue <https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok/issues/new>`_ with the error message.

Though the add-on is installed you can't use its full power now. There are nodes which you won't be able to see
in the menu until extra libraries will be installed. The list of unavailable nodes is printed in the system
console during add-on initialization. Read more about installing the libraries in the next section.
