## Installation instructions

The current [development versions of Sverchok (master)](https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok/archive/master.zip) are designed to work with the latest Blender `2.8x`, for Blender versions 2.79 and lower please use [Sverchok for Blender 2.79](https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok/archive/279_master.zip)

Downloading and installing for the first time? We have a handy guide to keep that process as painless as possible: [the read.me](https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok/#installation)

Sverchok does require a working numpy package, and usually Blender ships with numpy in a working form, any issues should be addressed in that thread, otherwise please say something in that thread (preferably also show the error message if you get one)
